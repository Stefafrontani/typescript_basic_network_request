# Typescript

## Project summary

Make a network request to fetch some JSON and print the result. Throwing some "accidental" errors to show the importance of typescript or what it is meant to solve.

## Run

There are two ways
1 - Run
`$ ts-node index.ts`
2 - Run
`$ tsc index.ts` // This command will create a .js file readable by node
`$ node index.js` // This will send the file to node
